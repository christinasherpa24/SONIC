## Purpose

The purpose of this package is to provide information about the countries of the world. The functions serve two purposes. First, gain information about a specific country. Second, gain information about a specific issue for all countries (ex: abortion access or environmental issues).

## Target

The target audience for this package is anyone who is interested in facts about the world. Specifically, we are aiming to appeal to people who play games such as the Worldle and Globle. Additionally, this package can be used by people who are looking for information from all countries for a specific issue or issues surrounding a region (neighboring countries). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of SONIC like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("christinasherpa24/SONIC")
```
## Package Proposal 

We intend to create a package that will allow users to get information about a variety of issues for specific countries. So far, we have information about geography (bordering countries), carbon emissions, and population (from 2000-2022). We plan to add much more information such as women's right which can include aspects such as a women's right to vote or access to abortion as well as LGBTQ+ matters.
